CLI Chat with Websockets Real-time communication is essential in the digital era. 
 Your task is to develop a Command Line Interface (CLI) chat application using Websockets that allows users to have interactive conversations seamlessly. Suggested Tasks You're encouraged to choose any suitable backend technology for building the CLI chat application with Websockets. Popular choices include Node.js, Python, or Go lang. Code cleanliness and maintainability are vital. Follow a structured architecture like MVC, MVVM, etc., and avoid monolithic single-file code. Although WebSocket libraries are commonly used, feel free to select any technology stack that aligns with your expertise for implementing Websockets.


  Bonus Tasks While not mandatory, incorporating test cases into your application will be highly valued and highlight your commitment to code quality. Database integration is also a plus. Providing clear documentation on the chosen tech stack and architectural decisions will enhance the overall quality of your project. Ensure your CLI chat application is well-documented for usage, setup, and any additional functionalities through a README.md file or similar method. 
  
  Additional Notes Share your functional code through a public GitHub repository and create a comprehensive README.md file that offers clear instructions. If you deploy the application and provide thorough documentation, your project will receive extra recognition.
